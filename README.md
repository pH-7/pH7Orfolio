# pH7Ortfolio

My **Simple Portfolio** website built with MeteorJs and Bootstrap frameworks.

If you like Meteor.js like me, you can see others [I made here](https://github.com/AwesomeMobileApps) but there are not completely finished (sorry :smiley:).


## Requirements

- Your server needs [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

- On production, don't forget to remove the Meteor *insecure* package, by typing the following in your project `meteor remove insecure`.
